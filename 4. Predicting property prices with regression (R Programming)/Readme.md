## 1. Project Overview

A city had a plan to extend a local road from 2 lanes to 4 lanes. However, doing that would affect some of the properties in that area since they would be required to not only give up some of their spaces to the city, but also, they would have to experience the increase in traffic. Therefore, the city asked for help to determine those property prices, as they needed to give compensation to those people who would be affected by the construction. If the city was challenged in court over the compensation claims, we would need to determine the loss of market value for each homeowner and defend our strategy.


## 2. Data

The dataset in this project can be downloaded from  [here.](https://github.com/yadabasac/project/blob/main/4.%20Predicting%20property%20prices%20with%20regression%20(R%20Programming)/1.%20Dataset/Property%20features%20dataset.csv)

Below is the exploratory data analysis of the attributes we will use to predict a property price.
**Table 1:**
| Attribute  | Mean | Standar Deviation |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Area of lot (sqft)	 | 11,959.63	 | 9,593.12
| Area of frontage (sqft)	 | 902.63	 | 255.55
| Traffic counts (vehicles per day)	 | 20,221.15	 | 8,368.87
| One and a half Stories (%)	 | 0.09	 | 0.28
| Two Stories (%)	 | 0.15	 | 0.36
| Average interior condition (%)	 | 0.45	 | 0.5
| Good interior condition (%)	 | 0.34	 | 0.47
| Excellent interior condition (%)	 | 0.12	 | 0.32
| Four lane road	 | 0.33	 | 0.47

To come up with reasonable compensations for residential properties, we decided to use the multiple regression model. It gives the most accurate numbers by using a formula to calculate prices while the traditional methods allow different evaluators to say different prices.

Generally, the price of a home is based on different factors and ownersâ€™ decisions. For example, house size, lot size, home features, interior or exterior condition, location, etc. 

## 3. Results and Evaluation

We built two models. Model I estimates house prices based on whether they are located on a typical residential road or four-lane road and other variables. Model II uses traffic counts instead of a dummy variable showing whether a house located on a typical residential road or four-lane road. Variables in our models are chosen because we think that they are important in determining our house prices and they do not show any multicollinearity problems.

### 3.2. Explaining Results

For each additional square footage of frontage area, on average it increases the home price by $26.48 holding the house type, area of lot, Interior condition constant in Model I. It raises the price by $28.16 holding the other variables in Model II. If the house is on four lane road in Model I, on average it decreases by $11,394.39 holding the other variables constant. For each additional traffic counts in Model II, on average it decreases by $0.71 controlling for other variables.

In Model I that includes a set of dummy variables for the house type, interior condition, four-lane road. The home price associated with two storeies house cost average $6,556.90 more than a one storey housecontrolling for other variables. In Model II, including a measure of the traffic amount, The home price associated with two storeies house cost average $1,369.40 less. But in both models, interior condition is not statiscally significant. The signs of the interior condition  are intuitive.

As we estimate the home prices in order to come up with reasonable compensation, the R squared from the mutiple regression models table can be use as a measure to determine how well our models make predictions. From the table, not only all the statistically significant variables (area of lot, area of frontage, and dummy variables for the interior condition) increases the home price as anticipated. Our models are also acceptable because R squared in Model I is 0.43 and in Model II is 0.44.

The city can use either Model I (lane sideroad) or Model II (traffic counts) to calculate compensation amounts for the affected homeowners. Model II is used to calculate compensation using data of traffic counts. Since the traffic counts on the newly paved four lane road are expected to reach 33,000 cars per day, the mathematical expression for Model II in calculating compensation can be expressed as below:
 
Compensation (Model II) = 12,000.00 + 28.16 * (Loss frontage) + 0.71 * (33,000 - current traffic counts) 

On the other hand, Model I is different from Model II in that it estimates house prices based on whether they are located on a typical residential road or four-lane road. Thus, mathematical expression in calculating compensation for house currently located on a two-lane road is: 
 
Compensation (Model I) = 12,000.00 + 26.48 * (Loss frontage) + 11,394.39
 
If a house is currently located on a four-lane road, then the following expression should be used.
 
Compensation (Model I) = 12,000.00 + 26.48 * (Loss frontage)
