This project focuses on predicting flight delays for six major US airlines using machine learning models. Delayed aircraft are estimated to have cost the airlines several billion dollars in additional expense. Delays also drive the need for extra gates and ground personnel and impose costs on airline customers (including shippers) in the form of lost productivity, wages and goodwill. Results indicate the models' ability to accurately forecast delays, with improvements noted through data balancing and feature reduction. Such insights are pivotal for crafting more effective air traffic management strategies, curbing delays, and their economic ramifications.

In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, pet ownership is on the rise, with more individuals and families welcoming pets into their homes but struggling to have quality time with their pets. Thus, there comes a growing need for reliable and efficient pet care services. Pet Sitters recognizes this market opportunity and aims to capitalize on it by building a pet sitting database to pair professional pet sitters with households requiring pet sitting services. This report outlines the rationale behind this project and highlights the benefits it will bring to the company.

A pet sitting database will enable us to offer a more personalized and tailored experience to our customers. By maintaining comprehensive profiles of each pet and their respective owners, we can capture important details such as dietary preferences, and behavioral traits. This information will enable our pet sitters to provide customized care that meets the unique needs of every pet, fostering stronger relationships with both pets and their owners. Additionally, the database will enable us to track and analyze customer feedback, allowing us to continuously improve the quality of our services and revise our training programs of professional pet sitters.

## 3. How much cash should my company hold? (Regression & SAS)

Our model aids management teams in determining a firm's optimal cash level, tailored to its unique structure. For example, if a firm wants to expand its operations, thus expecting higher sales growth, then our model can predict how much a firm should increase its cash level. Similarly, if a firm is expecting more cash inflow from its operations, our model can help them decide how much they should decrease their cash level. Despite this, the level of cash in each company should be considered together with the specific economic events in the country, and the specific events in the industry the company is operating. The varying positive and negative coefficients on year and industry dummies in our model indicate that major economic or industry events can also influence the optimal level of cash.

## 4. How much should I pay for this house? (Regression & R Programming)

A city had a plan to extend a local road from 2 lanes to 4 lanes. However, doing that would affect some of the properties in that area since they would be required to not only give up some of their spaces to the city, but also, they would have to experience the increase in traffic. Therefore, the city asked for help to determine those property prices, as they needed to give compensation to those people who would be affected by the construction. If the city was challenged in court over the compensation claims, we would need to determine the loss of market value for each homeowner and defend our strategy. We will build two regression models to predict those house prices.
