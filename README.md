This project focuses on predicting flight delays for six major US airlines using machine learning models. Delayed aircraft are estimated to have cost the airlines several billion dollars in additional expense. Delays also drive the need for extra gates and ground personnel and impose costs on airline customers (including shippers) in the form of lost productivity, wages and goodwill. Results indicate the models' ability to accurately forecast delays, with improvements noted through data balancing and feature reduction. Such insights are pivotal for crafting more effective air traffic management strategies, curbing delays, and their economic ramifications.

## 2. Estimating Optimal Cash Levels

Our model aids management teams in determining a firm's optimal cash level, tailored to its unique structure. For example, if a firm wants to expand its operations, thus expecting higher sales growth, then our model can predict how much a firm should increase its cash level. Similarly, if a firm is expecting more cash inflow from its operations, our model can help them decide how much they should decrease their cash level. Despite this, the level of cash in each company should be considered together with the specific economic events in the country, and the specific events in the industry the company is operating. The varying positive and negative coefficients on year and industry dummies in our model indicate that major economic or industry events can also influence the optimal level of cash.
