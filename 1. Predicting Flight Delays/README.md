## 1. Introduction

Flight delays pose significant economic challenges to the aviation industry, necessitating efficient air traffic management strategies. This project focuses on predicting flight delays for six major US airlines using machine learning models. By assessing data balancing techniques and feature reduction, the study aims to enhance predictive performance. Results indicate the models' ability to accurately forecast delays, with improvements noted through data balancing and feature reduction. Such insights are pivotal for crafting more effective air traffic management strategies, curbing delays, and their economic ramifications. Accurate predictions empower airlines to preemptively mitigate delays' impact on passengers and industry. The study sourced flight data from major US airlines and employed machine learning algorithms for prediction, evaluating performance using various metrics. Overall, the research underscores machine learning's potential in predicting flight delays and optimizing air traffic management. These findings offer actionable insights for airlines and industry stakeholders to inform decisions aimed at reducing delays and associated costs. Leveraging datasets like the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset enables precise estimation of flight punctuality probabilities.

## 2. Datasets


The dataset utilized for this project comprises flight data sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Due to computational constraints, a smaller sample dataset provided by IBM was chosen, focusing on flight data from six major airlines: Southwest, Delta, American Airlines, Republic, JetBlue, and Alaska, spanning January 2018 to December 2020. Additionally, weather data from the Integrated Surface Database (ISD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was integrated, considering attributes such as windspeed, cloud height, visibility, temperature, rain, and snow at both departure and arrival airports. The primary classification variable is arrival delay, categorized as 1 for delays exceeding 15 minutes and 0 otherwise. Graphical analysis reveals American Airlines as the leading carrier in terms of flight volume, with Delta Airlines demonstrating the lowest delay percentage, while JetBlue struggles the most with delays. Analysis of flight volumes by day of the week highlights weekdays as busier periods, with Thursdays and Fridays exhibiting the highest delay percentages. Furthermore, there's an observed increase in flight activity during winter months, notably January and March, and a concentration of delays around the 18th to 20th days of the month, suggesting potential areas for advanced planning by both passengers and airlines.
