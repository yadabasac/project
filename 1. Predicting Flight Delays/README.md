## 1. Introduction

Flight delays pose significant economic challenges to the aviation industry, necessitating efficient air traffic management strategies. This project focuses on predicting flight delays for six major US airlines using machine learning models. By assessing data balancing techniques and feature reduction, the study aims to enhance predictive performance. Results indicate the models' ability to accurately forecast delays, with improvements noted through data balancing and feature reduction. Such insights are pivotal for crafting more effective air traffic management strategies, curbing delays, and their economic ramifications. Accurate predictions empower airlines to preemptively mitigate delays' impact on passengers and industry. The study sourced flight data from major US airlines and employed machine learning algorithms for prediction, evaluating performance using various metrics. Overall, the research underscores machine learning's potential in predicting flight delays and optimizing air traffic management. These findings offer actionable insights for airlines and industry stakeholders to inform decisions aimed at reducing delays and associated costs. Leveraging datasets like the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset enables precise estimation of flight punctuality probabilities.
